# Play with parallax scrolling. 
Initial commit demonstrates background image parallax scroll but works for only a single instance. It also has 3 divs that scroll in diferent directions at diferent rates.
# Next step will be to make parallax scrolling work in multiple divs
Do this in a seperate branch?
